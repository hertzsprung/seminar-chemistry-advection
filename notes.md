aim of the talk?
- take a look at 

- chemical species often corellated, e.g. NO\_y and N\_2O (plumb2007)
- ozone hole can be measured by a lack of correlation (proffitt1990)
- correlations do not change due to advection, only due to diffusion or chemical reactions
- a "tracer" is a chemical specie, aerosol, water constituent etc
- *sum* of tracers is often important, too, e.g. total chlorine...
- tracers advected separately, so corellations are not preserved

# mixing scatter plot

- advection schemes can create numerical mixing and numerical unmixing (through numerical dispersion errors)
- advection schemes will always have these errors because they are only discrete approximations
- for a particular scheme, do the numerical errors look like observed, "real mixing"?

- real mixing between two parcels is a straight line
- real mixing between two correlated tracers all the straight lines -> convex hull
- draw Fig 1 from lauritzen-thuburn2011 piece-by-piece

- show some results
  - CSLAM-CN5.5 1.5deg (good)
  - MPAS-CN0.8 1.5deg (bad)
